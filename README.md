# Pokemon nextjs Lab

## Hi I'm Carolina

I am handing this as a school lab. The goal was to fix a bunch of bugs that were inside the pages.

## Bugs I found

- Fixed the API url

- Useeffect dependency was looping back into the api, causing an infinite got rid of that/

- Added a try and catch for all fetches in the files.

- fixed pokemon route from pokemon?id=1 , to pokemon/${id}

- I added a template literal into the fetch that was inside the [id]/ page

- Fixed the property for the pokemon image to have the proper navigation inside the object we are getting it from.

- Added a try, to test if response was ok in the fetch that's in page.js

I did learn better where the try and catch goes when fetching. I was a little confused on where exactly to place it. This has cleared it up for me.

UseEffect it still a bit blurry, but more clear on how I use it. I think I need to use it more to really understand what it is. I understand that it synchronizes a component with what would be the final value of something outside.

I also learned that layout.js is in charge of making sure all elements are positionally correct for the pages.
